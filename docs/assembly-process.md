# Assembly Process
## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step physical assembly of the system, including component installation and basic validation checks. The process mirrors standard hardware deployment and build procedures used in enterprise and data center environments.

### 1. Workspace Preparation

Description:
Prepared a clean, static-safe workspace prior to assembly.

Actions Taken:

Used a large, flat surface for component layout

Ensured adequate lighting

Grounded myself to reduce static discharge risk

Verified all components against the inventory list

Validation:

No visible damage to components

All required parts accounted for before assembly
